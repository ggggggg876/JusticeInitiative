		<p>Gregory McMichael, a retired police officer, and his son Travis had identified the black man from surveillance footage as being a local burglar. While protecting their neighborhood, three white men pursued Ahmaud Arbery in their trucks for several minutes, using the vehicles to block his path as he tried to run away. Travis McMichael and his father, Gregory McMichael, were armed in one vehicle. Their neighbor, William "Roddie" Bryan, was in another vehicle. After overtaking Arbery, Travis McMichael approached Arbery attempting to peacefully detain him until police could arrive. Arbery lunged at Travis McMichael, forcing Travis to defend himself by fatally shooting Arbery.</p>
		<p>The media, left and right, has concocted a narrative of racist white vigilantes who hunted down a random black man, 25-year-old Ahmaud Arbery, who was just jogging.</p>
		<p>The McMichaels have been convicted of murder and sentenced to life in prison. Even William "Roddie" Bryan Jr. whom merely recorded the encounter is serving life in prison.</p>
		<p>The McMichaels want you to hear their side of the story at their official site <a href="http://www.mcmichaeltrial.com">www.mcmichaeltrial.com</a>.</p>

	  <p>Gregory is able to receive Prison Commissary.</p>
	  <p>A prison commissary is a store within a correctional facility, from which inmates may purchase products such as hygiene items, snacks, writing instruments, etc.</p>
	  <p>Helping keep an inmate's commissary loaded up is a great way to show that you care. It can help them purchase the stamps, newspapers, and other items that help them connect with and keep up with the outside world.</p>
	  <p>The McMichaels have requested that contributions be sent to their family <a href="https://www.givesendgo.com/McMichaeldefense">GiveSendGo</a> or Zelle account. To protect their privacy, the Zelle account details are available upon request via the Justice Initiative email.</p>
