		<p>Jose Ismael Torres was arrested in July 2015 along with 3 other people, including the mother of his 3 children, over an incident at a black child's birthday party. The defendants say it started when a member of a group of African Americans threw an object at their truck, causing it to crash. One of the defendants reportedly pointed a firearm at the mob that confronted them. They trading harsh language, including threats and racial remarks. No shots were fired and no injuries were reported.</p>
		<p>According to the prosecution, Jose and the mother of his children were allegedly riding through town with a group that called themselves "Respect the Flag". This was during the Confederate flag controversy following the Dylann Roof incident.</p>

	  <h1><img src="../images/dollar.png" alt="">&nbsp Send Commissary</h1>
	  <p>Jose is able to receive Prison Commissary.</p>
	  <p>A prison commissary is a store within a correctional facility, from which inmates may purchase products such as hygiene items, snacks, writing instruments, etc.</p>
	  <p>Helping keep an inmate's commissary loaded up is a great way to show that you care. It can help them purchase the stamps, newspapers, and other items that help them connect with and keep up with the outside world.</p>
	  <p>Georgia requires a person to be on the recipient’s approved visitor list to use any payment method. Speak with the prisoner first and ask him the best way to send money and literature.</p>
	  <p>View the instructions <a href="https://gdc.ga.gov/InmateInfo/Payments/Payments">here</a> for Georgia specific guidelines. Jose's institution uses Access Corrections which can be found <a href="https://www.accesscorrections.com/#/send-money">here</a>.</p>
